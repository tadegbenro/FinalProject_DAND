# FinalProject_DAND
Final project for the Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree to demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process

## Project Objectives
The purpose of this project is to 
1. Use Python and Python visualization lbraries to systematically explore a selected datase, and 
2. From the exploration, create a short present that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that was  discovered

## Project Description
The data set selected for this project is the [Loan Data from Prosper](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv&sa=D&ust=1554486256021000). The dataset had a record of 113,937 loans managed by Prosper with 81 data points per entry.

The primary question explored in this project is to determine how effective the Rating model (created by Prosper to qualify borrowers) was in predicting how well a loan performs. Also to be explored is how attributes associated with the borrower (i.e income, employment status) and the loan (i.e APR, monthly payments) also influence loan performance.
